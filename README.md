# Gizmo — Professional Interactive Web Introduction

**Gizmo** is a modern, interactive web experience built with cutting-edge frontend technologies to deliver immersive visuals, smooth animations, and a strong product-oriented narrative.

This website was independently built by me as a professional showcase for **[atma science company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atmasciences/)**. It was created on my own initiative and is not affiliated with, commissioned by, or officially endorsed by the company.

The project represents an evolution of their existing page, **https://gizmo.party/**, and explores the potential of expanding Gizmo beyond a mobile-only experience into a full-featured web presence.

> ⚠️ This project is **not open source**.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was developed as a conceptual and technical update to Gizmo’s current web presence, translating the product’s vision into a scalable, high-performance website.

While Gizmo is currently available as a mobile application on **Android and iOS**, this project implicitly demonstrates how its experience, brand, and interactions can be extended into the web ecosystem—bridging mobile and web through consistent design, animation, and performance standards.
